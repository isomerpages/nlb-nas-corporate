#### **About Us**

Since 1969, the Archives Conservation Lab (ACL) has been dedicated to preserving Singapore’s paper-based archival records dating back to the 1800s. Items that we work on include manuscripts, bound volumes, maps, architectural drawings, photographs, and posters.

#### **What We Do**

ACL undertakes both preventive measures and interventive conservation treatments          to protect and store records of significance for posterity. Preventive care involves pest management, monitoring and controlling storage environments in line with international standards, and housing items in archival enclosures. Interventive treatments include cleaning and physical repairs that stabilise fragile or deteriorated records.

ACL also supports exhibitions to safely display records. In addition, we provide conservation consultations for the National Library Board as well as other government agencies, and offer training to staff on proper collection handling and care.

Committed to advancing the field, ACL actively participates in regional and international conservation forums by contributing research and collaborating with global partners. ACL also inspires the public through education and outreach — sharing knowledge and sparking interest in the field through talks and on social media, to make conservation accessible for all.
