<h3>About the Exhibition</h3>
<p>A constitution is a legal document that lays out the structure of government
and the fundamental laws and principles governing a country and its people.
In Singapore, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is the supreme
law of the land that all other local laws must conform to. It prescribes
the important distribution of authority between the three arms of the state:
the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. It safeguards fundamental
rights Singaporeans enjoy, such as equality before the law, equal protection
of the law and the freedom of religion, among others. The sovereignty of
Singapore is entrenched within the constitution. It has been called a “pragmatic
document” that provides the framework for social, political and economic
development that helps Singapore thrive.</p>
<p><em>Law of the Land: Highlights of Singapore’s Constitutional Documents</em> explores
the history and development of Singapore’s constitution from Singapore’s
founding as a British settlement in 1819 to its emergence as a sovereign
republic in 1965.</p>
<p>The exhibition features rare constitutional documents from the collections
of the National Archives of Singapore and National Library, Singapore.
The documents capture key moments in Singapore’s constitutional history
and also throw light on milestones in our island-nation’s history.</p>
<p>The exhibition is held at the historic former Chief Justice’s Chamber
and Office at the National Gallery Singapore.</p>
