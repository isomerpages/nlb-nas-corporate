<h3><strong>Archives Unlocked | From Jurong Island to Selat Sembilan</strong></h3>
<p>This talk draws from <em>Socio-Cultural Heritage of Jurong Island and its Former Offshore Islands</em>,
a NHB Heritage Research Grant project that utilsed archival maps, oral
histories, and GIS visualisation to trace the lived experiences of island
communities (including, Malay, Teochew, Orang Suku Laut and others) before
the formation of Jurong Island. Using materials from the National Archives
of Singapore—such as 19th-century hydrographic charts, oral history recordings,
and declassified government documents—Dr Hadi Osni examines how place names,
ecological knowledge, and kinship ties offer alternative ways of remembering
and representing these maritime landscapes. The talk highlights how archival
materials can be recontextualised through memory mapping and participatory
research.</p>
<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong>
</p>
<p>Dr. Hadi Osni is a curator at the Malay Heritage Centre under Singapore’s
National Heritage Board. His research focuses on architectural and urban
history, community heritage, and spatial memory in Singapore’s built environment.&nbsp;He
is Co-Investigator of the NHB-funded project Socio-Cultural Heritage of
Jurong Island and Former Offshore Islands (2023–2025), where he led oral
history, archival, and GIS research to document the lives of former island
residents. The project culminated in the From Jurong Island to Selat Sembilan
exhibition at the NUS Museum.</p>
