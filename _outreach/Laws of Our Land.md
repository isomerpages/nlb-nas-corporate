<h3>ABOUT THE EXHIBITION</h3>
<p>About seven decades ago, the identity and legal status of Singapore citizens
did not exist, wives in Singapore were not treated as equal partners in
marriage, and Singapore’s archaic employment laws were unsuited for a modern
industrial economy. But all this changed with the introduction of three
laws that are featured in a refreshed exhibition by the National Library
Board (NLB).</p>
<p><strong><em>Laws of Our Land: Foundations of a New Nation </em></strong>puts
a spotlight on the Citizenship Ordinance, the Women’s Charter, and the
Employment Act. Through the 37 artefacts and reproductions on display from
the collections of the National Archives of Singapore, the National Library
and partner institutions such as Singapore's Supreme Court, and a host
of multimedia and interactive features, visitors will learn about the historical
background and circumstances that led to the passing of these laws.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of the Three Laws:</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Citizenship Ordinance</strong> (1957) created the legal status
of Singapore citizen and paved the way for Singapore to become a self-governing
state and later an independent nation-state.</p>
<p>The <strong>Women’s Charter</strong> (1961) introduced a unitary monogamous
law to govern non-Muslim marriage and protection of the rights of women
and has been the legislation at the core of Singapore family law.</p>
<p>The <strong>Employment Act</strong> (1968) modernised Singapore’s labour
laws to meet the needs of the new industrial economy and remains Singapore’s
main labour law regulating the basic terms and working conditions for employees
in Singapore.</p>
<p>These laws serve as foundation pillars of our nation by continuing to
shape and underpin the rights and identities of Singapore’s citizens, women
and workers.</p>

<p><strong>Power of attorney, 1906.</strong> 
<br>Koh Seow Chuan Collection, National Library, Singapore
<br>B26057119I</p>
<p>Under British law during the colonial period, married women lost rights
to their property. Even though Muslim law allowed women to retain their
property rights even after marriage, the patriarchal structure of Singapore’s
colonial society made it difficult for women to administer their own property,
and led them to legally depend on their husbands or male relatives. Such
powers of attorney are documentary traces of how some Muslim women signed
over the rights to administer their property to their male relatives in
this patriarchal society.</p>

<p><strong>Employment Act<br>from <em>Republic of Singapore Acts, Nos. 1–47 of 1986</em></strong>
<br>Singapore: Government Printer, 1968
<br>On loan from Supreme Court, Singapore</p>
<p>The Employment Act of 1968 is a landmark legislation that has had a profound
impact on the nature of work and workers in Singapore. It was enacted shortly
after Singapore’s independence and is the cornerstone of employment law.
The act consolidated previous labour laws and introduced a range of crucial
employment standards and protections. Over time, the act has evolved to
keep pace with changing labour market dynamics and societal needs, reflecting
Singapore’s commitment to maintaining a competitive yet equitable legal
framework that balances the interests of employers and employees, fostering
industrial harmony, and supporting Singapore’s economy.</p>

<p>The Labour Ordinance of 1920 was a significant consolidation of previous
labour laws, both race-specific and non-race-specific. It covered in detail
the terms and conditions of labour agreements and contracts pertaining
to wages, termination, leave and more. It also abolished the ‘truck system’
where workers were paid in forms other than money, and mandated access
to housing, water, sanitation and medical treatment for estate workers,
who worked in remote areas.</p>
